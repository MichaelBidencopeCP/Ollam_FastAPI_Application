# Ollama_FastAPI_Application

A project to demonstrate my understanding of **microservices**, implementing a **local LLM**, and **FastAPI**.

The current functionality I am working on uses **Google SSO** for user authentication, allowing me to pull data from the **Google Calendar API**. This data will provide context to the LLM model, enabling the user to ask for a **summary of their day**.

---

## Currently Working

- Google SSO authentication
- Simple FastAPI endpoint
- Barebones frontend with a working sign-in button that directs the user to the Google SSO page

---

## TODO

- Implement post-authentication logic:  
  The Django app should save the Google credentials and redirect the user back to the frontend with a JWT token.
- Set up JWT token authentication for the FastAPI endpoint.
- Use gRPC (or another protocol) to pull the Google credentials from the auth system so user credentials can be used to pull data from the Google API.
- Integrate with **Ollama** to leverage LLM:
  - Feed API data from Google to the LLM
  - Separate different users' chats
  - Complete additional implementation steps
- Build out a simple frontend for the app.
- Brainstorm and plan additional features to include.

---

## Future Ideas

- Daily email or Slack summaries generated by the LLM.
- Voice assistant integration for “What’s on my calendar today?”
- Dashboard with summaries and quick actions.
